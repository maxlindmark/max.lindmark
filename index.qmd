Hi!

I'm a quantitative ecologist working as a research scientist at the Institute of Marine Research, Swedish University of Agricultural Sciences in Lysekil, Sweden. I use statistical and mathematical models to study ecological impacts of climate change to improve our understanding and management of marine ecosystems.

Specifically, my research focuses mainly on:

- Impacts of climate change on species distributions
- Climate effects on the growth, body size and size-structure of fishes
- Spatiotemporal modelling of ecological processes
- Dynamics and structure of size-based food webs using process-based modelling (for this line of research, I'm also involved in the  [FishMIP](https://www.isimip.org/about/marine-ecosystems-fisheries/))

In my free time I like to tinker with my bicycle. And occasionally ride it too, with my family if I can choose. And cook food, ideally something fermented.

Feel free to [contact](contact) me if you want to get in touch, or if you want collaborate on a project or even a grant proposal! I have experience applying for grants from the Swedish Research Councils and also smaller foundations and can supervise postdocs.
