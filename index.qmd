Hi! I'm a quantitative ecologist and a research scientist based in Lysekil, Sweden, at the Institute of Marine Research. I use statistical and mathematical models to study ecological impacts of climate change. 

Specifically, my research focuses mainly on:

- Impacts of climate change on species distributions and body size
- Spatiotemporal modelling of ecological processes
- Dynamics and structure of size-based food webs
- Metabolic Ecology

I enjoy working with R and often use packages such as [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/index.html) and [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) in my research.

In my free time I like to tinker with my bicycle. And occasionally ride it too, with my family if I can choose. And cook food, ideally something fermented.

Feel free to [contact](contact) me if you want to get in touch, or if you want collaborate on a project or even a grant proposal! I have experience applying for grants from the Swedish Research Councils and also smaller foundations.
