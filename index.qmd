I'm a quantitative marine ecologist trying to understand how organisms, populations and communities respond to climate change. Specifically, I explore growth rates, body size and the spatiotemporal distribution of species change over time in relation to climate and ecological processes.

Feel free to [contact](contact) me if you want to get in touch or collaborate!
