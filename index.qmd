I'm a researcher working to improve our understanding of how ecosystems respond to climate change. My research mainly focuses on the impacts of climate change on the spatial distribution of species and their body growth and size, but also ecological interactions among species. I'm an enthusiastic R user and enjoy working with packages such as [sdmTMB](https://pbs-assess.github.io/sdmTMB/index.html) and [brms](https://paul-buerkner.github.io/brms/) in my research.

In my free time I like to tinker with my bicycle. And occasionally ride it too, with my family if I can choose. And cook food, ideally something fermented.

Feel free to [contact](contact) me if you want to get in touch or collaborate on a grant proposal!
