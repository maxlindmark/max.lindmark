    "text": "I’m a postdoc working to improve our understanding of how ecosystems respond to climate change. Specifically, I study how climate change affects the abundance and distribution of species, life history traits and body size distributions, and interactions among species in ecological communities. I’m an enthusiastic R user and enjoy working with packages such as sdmTMB and brms in my research.\nIn my free time I like to ride my bicycle with my family and cook food, ideally something fermented.\nFeel free to contact me if you want to get in touch or collaborate on a grant proposal!"
