Specifically, I study how climate change affects the abundance and distribution of species, life history traits and body size distributions, and interactions among species in ecological communities. I enjoy working with statistical models in R when doing research.\nIn my free time I like to ride my bicycle with my family and cook food—- ideally something fermented.\nFeel free to contact me if you want to get in touch or collaborate on a grant proposal!"
